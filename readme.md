# ElectroHavocV1
Top-down 2d shooter for a game jam with the prompt "chain reaction". Dubbed Electro Havoc, the objective is to stay alive as long as possible while destroying as many enemies as possible. 

## Planned Additions
* ~Concept of waves~
* Player and enemy death animations
* Score (points, time alive, kill count)
* Pathfinding (reading about A* algorithm and Godot's implementation of it)
* BG music and sfx
* Figure out how to make particles damage other enemies (thus delivering on the "chain reaction" prompt)
* ~Varied enemies with health~
* Power-ups and different weapons, if only to change bullet sprite and particle design
